## Bugs

### Data Protection

- A user can view another users checkout success order.  

- A logged in user can view another users profile order history.

- Unregistered user

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/anonymous_user.JPG)

- Unregistered user viewing another users order

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/sensitive_info.JPG)

#### Solution

- The @login_required decorator ensures that a user must be logged in to access this view. If the user is not logged in, they'll be redirected to the login page.

- The order_number passed to the view is used to retrieve an Order object from the database using get_object_or_404, which will either return the order or raise a 404 error if not found.

- If the logged-in user’s profile exists, it is fetched.

- If the user_profile of the order does not match the logged-in user’s profile, the user is denied access and shown a 404 error page.

- If no user_profile is associated with the order, the view tries to assign the logged-in user’s profile to the order (if they are authenticated). This is useful when the order was initially made without a user profile but is later associated with a logged-in user.

- The above solution is implemented in the checkout app checkout success view and the profiles app order history view.

### Empty Quantity Input

- A user can leave the product quantity input field empty caucing an error.

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/qty-input-empty.JPG)

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/qty-input-empty-error.JPG)

#### Solution

- When a user leaves the quantity input field empty the following code automatically enters a quantity of 1 in the field `quantity = int(request.POST.get('quantity') or 1)`

## Unfixed Bugs

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
